DISCLAIMER
The Inovation hub cannot be used for any comemrcial activities, as such it has significant resource allocations to prevent such comemrcial usage.
The infastucture is normally offline, and takes some time to reallocate resouces after any peiood of non usage.
This resopurce allcoations will normally exceed the default timeouts for most infastcutrure serives, hence any user will need to process such timeouts.
This will normally require a sresubmission of the failed function until successful and tyhe Inovation Hub has assumed an operational Sattus.
