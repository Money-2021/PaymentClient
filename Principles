Principles:
1. While the API is a RPC HTTP envionment all APDU's are stateless and hence self contained datagrams.
2. All Coins are stateless datagrams
3. Within the Finacial Market Infastucture, whcih includes the payment rail, there exist no accounts, no network, no seessions, no wallet and no counterparties 
4. All payments are between two payment Secure Identity enmdpoints, with absolute payment finality
5. A Coin moves offline, as a tangible bearer object, via a trusted path, and cannot be spent, hence it can never be double spent.
6. The cycle of a Coin->Mintâ€¦Move...Destroy demands that a single Coin balance, is always the result, of any payment flow, hence all Coins must have a temporal existance.
7. Each Coin is minted from one's own economic activity
8. Each individuals access to a COin, is an inalienable human right.
9. The Coin underpins permission-less, censorship-resistant, and universal payments as a public good to all of humanity...
